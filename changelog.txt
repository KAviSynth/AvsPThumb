2.0.4 [08.02.2019]
- Added:
    - Tabs shown an indicator if the AvsPmod Window allocated
    - 'Close all the next tabs'
    - Save and open tabs as Group (some menus)
    - Add tab to group (Added the current tab to a selected group)
    - 'Open Groups folder'
    - You can jump to the previous selected index with the forward or backward mouse button.
         - Hint: Is reset when changing the clip or the normal and favorites list.
    - Tabs can be moved to another position (Don't know is it new ;))
    - 'Hide Clip menu' (hides the Clip menu, see below)

- Menu 'Clip' is Beta: see Split Clip 
    - Auto Split  (Expands all saved split points to tabs)
    - Split  (Splits the selected index to new tab)
    - Join parts  (Join all splits to one Clip)
    - Merge with next 
    - Merge with previous
    - Sort parts (is automatic called on 'Split')
    - Save current Splits (Saves in the Bookstream the split points, saves also the selected indexes for each clip)

- Changed:
    - Tab preview shows now the selected index as preview
    - 'Clips to clip' can now be created with Bookstreams that contains different Thumbnaile sizes.
    - 'Clips to clip' saves the split points for each clip. You can expand the splits with 'Auto Split' see above (Menu 'Clip')
    - Look in the AvsPThumb.ini, there is an entry 'Tweaks' > 'ClipsToClipTweak' 
         - When set to 1, 'Clips to clip' doese allow a mix of 1920-16/9 and 1440-4/3 videos. Beta! 
         - In the avs file an attempt is made to compensate the different aspect ratios. 
         - I didn't invest much time in it. I am happy to accept better suggestions. Thanks.

Note to Split Clips: 
  Saving is only possible in new header version 2.0.4, so open your bookstreams (bk3, bk6) with the new version and save it again.
  'Clips to clip' must be new created for 'Auto Split', or you must select the splits manually and then saved with 'Save current splits'
