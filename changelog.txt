    - 'Clips to clip' saves the split points for each clip. You can expand the splits with 'Auto Split' see above (Menu 'Clip')

         - In the avs file an attempt is made to compensate the different aspect ratios. 
         - I didn't invest much time in it. I am happy to accept better suggestions. Thanks.

Note to Split Clips: 
  Saving is only possible in new header version 2.0.4, so open your bookstreams (bk3, bk6) with the new version and save it again.
  'Clips to clip' must be new created for 'Auto Split', or you must select the splits manually and then saved with 'Save current splits'
